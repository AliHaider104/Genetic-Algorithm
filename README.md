# Genetic-Algorithm âœ¨
C++ Implementation of Genetic Algorithm to Recreate Target Image

# Framework ðŸ‘€
Visual Studio / C++

# Description ðŸ‘‹
We have a target image and we have to recreate this image using Genetic algorithm. This program will generate the population of 100 images using random pixel values and then perform the basic steps of genetic algorithm (Selection,Cossover, Mutation) to finally produce the required image.
